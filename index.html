                The Star Wars saga is a highly acclaimed and iconic space opera franchise created by George Lucas.

The franchise quickly gained massive popularity and expanded into a multimedia phenomenon, including movies, TV shows, books, comics, video games, and more. The central narrative revolves around the conflict between the Jedi and the Sith, two opposing orders that wield the mystical Force.

                <h2>Star Wars Chronology Of Movies and Series</h2>
            </hgroup>

            <p>
                Viewing the movies in numerical order puts the movies in chronological order, and as you might guess, that's the preferred order of series creator George Lucas. It might be the most obvious choice, but it's not all that fun because it ruins the series' biggest twist by prematurely revealing the identity of Luke's father, an iconic Star Wars moment. Of course, this is only an option for veterans. Only Canon series and movies would do that. (the easiest option, of course, is to remove the animation series).

        <h3>The Return Of Ahsoka</h3>
       
        <p>Ahsoka Tano is a fictional character in the Star Wars universe. She first appeared in the 2008 animated film "Star Wars: The Clone Wars" and later became a central character in the "Star Wars: The Clone Wars" animated TV series, which ran from 2008 to 2020. Ahsoka is a Togruta, a species known for their distinctive head-tails called montrals and head-tails called lekku.
            <br>
            Ahsoka Tano is a Jedi Padawan who was trained by Anakin Skywalker, later known as Darth Vader, during the Clone Wars era. She quickly became a fan-favorite character due to her strong-willed and compassionate personality, as well as her skills in lightsaber combat and the Force. Ahsoka played a significant role in many battles and missions throughout the Clone Wars.
            <br>
            After leaving the Jedi Order, Ahsoka's story continued in other Star Wars media. She made her live-action debut in the second season of "The Mandalorian" TV series, which was released in 2020. Actress Rosario Dawson portrayed her in the show.
            <br>
            Ahsoka Tano's character development and journey from Padawan to independent Force user have made her a beloved and iconic figure in the Star Wars franchise. Her story has also continued in other Star Wars projects, including her own spin-off series titled "Ahsoka," which was announced by Lucasfilm and Disney in late 2020. This series will delve deeper into her adventures and explore her connection to the Force.</p>
